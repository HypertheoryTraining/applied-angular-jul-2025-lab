## Today

- Need Help Getting Your Code Caught Up?
- Getting more "real world" 
- Discovering State, Lifting State, Services, API Access, Etc.

- Effects Revisit
    - My demo yesterday stunk. We'll go over that again.


## Afternoon

- Lab 1 - Discovering, Lifting State

## Some Key Points From Day 1

- Angular is Evolving
    - `NgModules` are gone. Standalone components are "In".
    - Structural Directives in templates (e.g. `*ngFor, *ngIf) are going away. We have something better now.
    - State Management
        - Moving away from the 'zone.js' "hack".
        - State (data) should now always be (especially in components) done with:
            - Signals. 
            - Observables are fine, too.

    - Bundling - breaking your app into smaller JS "bundles" (chunks) to make it so that we can elevate changes more frequently with less
       negative impact for our users.
